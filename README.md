# Modelling-and-Real-time-Simulation-in-Machine-Automation
The aim of this exercise is to build a simulation model of a 4 actuator degree-of-freedom (DOF) hydraulic loader and to simulate it in real-time computer. This simulation model shall take into account the dynamics of the multi-body mechanical system as well as the dynamics (fluid compressibility, pressure generation) of the oil hydraulic system powering the loader. The loader will be driven in man-in-the-loop by commanding the spool position of the proportional valves in each of the four actuators. SimMechanics (Second Generation) and Simulink (from MATLAB software package) will be employed to model the multi-body mechanical system and the hydraulics respectively. After completing the offline simulation (i.e. simulation running under Matlab/Simulink environment), the simulation model will be compiled (using Matlab/Simulink Coder) and deployed to a real-time computer. In this real-time simulation platform, the commanding signals (spool displacements) will be generated by joysticks connected to a development PC, which will send the joystick axes positions to the real-time computer through an Ethernet UDP/IP connection. At the same time,   Page 2/8  the outputs (joint angles) of the simulation will be sent from the real-time computer back to the development computer via UDP/IP. In the development computer, the virtual visualization software, IHA3D, will read these joint values and render a 3D graphical representation of the forwarder loader in real-time.
